- [ ] Create a Proof-of-Concept (similiar to LFS books). *Under development, optimizing ..*
- [ ] Create a fast, flexible, and futuristic package manager.
- [ ] Build an auto build systems.
- [ ] Packaging, make it usable but with the aim of not being big.
> Always W.I.P, since this is hobbyist. A radical experiments.
